My name is Emily Abernathy.I am a 5th-year PhD candidate in the Graduate Group of Ecology at UC Davis where I am advised by [Dr. Josh Hull](https://animalscience.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/joshua-hull). When it comes to research I have two main interests, conservation genetics and adaptation genomics. I am interested in helping to bridge the gap between ecological geneticists and conservation managers to make genetics more accessible and applicable to the conservation of species. Secondly I am very passionate about understanding how species adapt to rapidly changing environments and how we can use this information to help preserve genetic diversity in the face of climate change. 

Before coming to UC Davis I got my bachelor's degree in Wildlife Biology at the University Of Vermont (Go Catamounts!). I have also previously worked for the Golden Gate Raptor Observatory, Point Blue Conservation Science, and Hawkwatch International. 

In my spare time you can find me playing ultimate frisbee, volunteer raptor banding for the Golden Gate Raptor Observatory, and hanging out with my Australian Shepherd Lupine.
