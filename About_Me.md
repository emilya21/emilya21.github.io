My name is Emily Abernathy.I am a 5th-year PhD candidate in the Graduate Group of Ecology at UC Davis where I am advised by [Dr. Josh Hull](https://animalscience.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/joshua-hull). I am broadly interested in conservation genetics and genomics and how we can study adaptation and speciation in order to inform conservation decisions.

Before coming to UC Davis I got my bachelor's degree in Wildlife Biology at the University Of Vermont (Go Catamounts!). I have also previously worked for the Golden Gate Raptor Observatory, Point Blue Conservation Science, and Hawkwatch International. 

In my spare time you can find me playing ultimate frisbee, volunteer raptor banding for the Golden Gate Raptor Observatory, and hanging out with my Australian Shepherd Lupine. 

Please feel free to send me an e-mail at eabernathy@ucdavis.edu or follow me on Twitter and Github using the links at the bottom of the page!
