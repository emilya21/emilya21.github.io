## Rapid Evolution and Adaptation in an Endemic Island Raptor
My primary area of study is the effects of natural enemy risk in biological control systems. Biological control, or the use of biological organisms to control unwanted organisms, is ultimately an issue of behavior, since pests are defined by their undesirable behavior. Caterpillars damage plants and reduce yield, aphids spread plant diseases, and cockroaches gross people out when they scurry around at night. Biological control is really about reducing these unwanted behaviors, and killing pests just happens to be an effective method of doing so. However, it's far from the only method, and natural enemies affect pests through plenty of non-lethal and non-consumptive pathways. I'm interested in studying these non-consumptive effects in biocontrol systems and how they interact with other pest control methods.

## Conservation genetics and genomics of the Swainson's Hawk (*Buteo swainsoni*)

I am currently working on a [USDA NIFA supported project](https://nifa.usda.gov/funding-opportunity/agriculture-and-food-research-initiative-education-workforce-development) using field and lab experiments to study the effects of multiple levels of risk on aphid population growth and alfalfa performance. Parasitoids affect aphids through both consumptive and non-consumptive pathways, but they also suffer their own consumptive and non-consumptive effects due to hyperparasitoids. I hope to elucidate the ways by which each specific pathway cascades to the level of aphid population growth and alfalfa performance, improving understanding of both aphid pest control and the broader topic of multiple risk cascades.

## Anticoagulant Rodenticide Exposure in Red-tailed Hawks

In my first year at UC Davis I conducted a study in collaboration with the Golden Gate Raptor Observatory on the effects of anticolagulant rodenticide poisoning on red-tailed hawks migrating through the Marin Headlands, CA. We took blood samples from 100 Red-tailed hawks and found trace amounts of anticoagulant rodenticides in 8% of sampled birds. These findings suggest that Red-tailed Hawks are being exposed to anticoagulant rodenticides somewhere along their migration route. Although this project is not my focus anymore you can find more awesome work on rodenticide exposure and raptor toxicology being done in my lab on our [website](https://hulllabucd.wixsite.com/hulllab/environmental-toxicology).
